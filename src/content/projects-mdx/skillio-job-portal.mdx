## 🚀 Overview

Skillio is a full-stack job portal platform designed to streamline the hiring workflow between recruiters and job seekers.

The platform supports role-based dashboards, secure authentication, job postings, and application tracking — simulating a real production hiring system.

---

## ❗ Problem

Traditional job platforms often lack:

- Clear recruiter dashboards
- Application tracking visibility
- Role-based workflows
- Secure authentication layers
- Scalable job filtering/search

Recruiters needed a clean way to manage postings and applicants, while job seekers required a structured application experience.

---

## 💡 Solution

I built a role-based full-stack platform that enables:

- Recruiters to post and manage jobs
- Job seekers to search and apply
- Secure login with protected routes
- Application lifecycle tracking

The system ensures separation of concerns between recruiter and job seeker functionalities.

---

## 🧩 Key Features

### 👨‍💼 Recruiter
- Post, edit, delete job listings
- View applicants per job
- Manage company profile
- Dashboard analytics view
- Secure password update

### 👨‍🎓 Job Seeker
- Browse & filter jobs
- Apply with resume
- Track application status
- Profile management

### 🔐 Authentication

- Protected routes & APIs
- Role authorization middleware

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Tech Decisions

### Frontend
- **Next.js App Router** for routing & SSR
- **Tailwind CSS** for scalable styling
- Component-based UI architecture

### Backend
- **Node.js + Express** REST APIs
- MVC folder structure
- Middleware for auth & validation

### Database
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose schemas
- Collections:
  - Users
  - Jobs
  - Applications

### Media Storage
- **Cloudinary** for image uploads (company logos, assets)

---

## 🔄 Workflow Design

1. Recruiter creates account  
2. Posts job listing  
3. Job seeker browses jobs  
4. Applies to role  
5. Recruiter views applicants  
6. Application status updated  

This simulates a real hiring lifecycle.

## ⚡ Challenges & Solutions

### 1) Secure Route Protection
**Challenge:** Prevent unauthorized dashboard access  
**Solution:** Implemented JWT middleware + role guards

---

### 2) Application Data Linking
**Challenge:** Mapping users → jobs → applications  
**Solution:** Used relational references in MongoDB schemas

---

### 3) Image Upload Handling
**Challenge:** Storing recruiter assets efficiently  
**Solution:** Integrated Cloudinary storage with upload middleware

---

### 4) Filtering & Search
**Challenge:** Dynamic job filtering  
**Solution:** Built tag-based filtering system with query params

---

## 📈 Results & Impact

- Designed scalable DB schema relationships
- Production-ready project structure

---
